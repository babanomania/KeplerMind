# TODO

## High Priority
- [ ] Implement real tool integrations for each agent module (search, vector store, evaluation) in `keplermind/agents/` to replace placeholder logic.
- [ ] Add environment configuration handling (API keys, service URLs) with validation in `keplermind/config.py`.

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Create automated tests for the LangGraph pipeline in `keplermind/tests/` including mocks for agent tools.
- [ ] Document agent interaction patterns and reflection cycles in the README for contributors.

## Low Priority
- [ ] Provide example notebooks demonstrating typical end-to-end usage scenarios.
- [ ] Set up CI workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions) for linting and unit testing.
